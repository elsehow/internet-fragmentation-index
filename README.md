# Per-country website popularity

Forked from [zakird/curx-top-lists](https://github.com/zakird/crux-top-lists/)

## Install

Get your [Google BigQuery admin credentials](https://www.progress.com/tutorials/jdbc/a-complete-guide-for-google-bigquery-authentication). Place the key .json in a folder (e.g., `creds`).

Make sure you have `nix` installed.

## Use

This command fetches the top 1000 websites (unordered) per country for all months (YYYY-MM) in the dataset.

```sh
# Enter the nix-shell.
nix-shell shell.nix
# Download the data
python3 cruxdownloader data/ creds/my-bigquery-creds.json 
```

# Cached Chrome Top Million Websites

[Recent research](https://zakird.com/papers/toplists.pdf) showed that the top
million most popular websites published by Google Chrome via their [UX
Report](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/) (CrUX) is significantly more
accurate than other top lists like the Alexa Top Million and Tranco Top
Million. 

This repository caches a CSV version of the Chrome top sites, queried from the
CrUX data in Google BigQuery. You can browse all of the cached lists
[here](https://github.com/zakird/crux-top-lists/tree/main/data/global). The
most up-to-date top million global websites can be downloaded directly at:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/zakird/crux-top-lists/main/data/global/current.csv.gz.

### Data Structure

The CrUX dataset has several important differences from other top lists:

1. Websites are bucketed by rank magnitude order, not by specific rank.
   Rank will be 1000, 10K, 100K, or 1M in the provided files. The data is
   ordered by rank magnitude. Within each order of magnitude, websites are
   listed randomly.

2. Websites are identified by _origin_ (e.g., https://www.google.com) not
   by domain or FQDN.

3. Data is released monthly, typically on the second Tuesday of the month.

This is an example of what the data looks like:

```
origin,rank
https://www.ptwxz.com,1000
https://ameblo.jp,1000
https://danbooru.donmai.us,1000
https://game8.jp,1000
https://www.google.com.au,1000
https://www.repubblica.it,1000
https://www.w3schools.com,1000
https://animekimi.com,1000
```

Websites are ranked by completed pageloads (measured
by First Contentful Paint) and aggregated by web origin. The dataset
adheres as closely as possible to user-initiated pageloads (e.g., it
excludes traffic from iframes). More information about CrUX and its data collection methodology can be found on its
official website: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/crux/about/.

### Why 1 Million Sites?

This repository does not contain all of the website ranking data published by
Chrome. Their global list of popular websites contains approximately 15M
websites. The top million websites captures over 95% of user traffic in Chrome
by both Page Loads and Time on Page ([Ruth et
al.](https://zakird.com/papers/browsing.pdf)) and is a reasonable
approximation:

</p>

If you want to use more or fewer websites, this is the approximate breakdown of coverage:

| Websites    | Page Loads  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| 1000        | 50%         |
| 10K         | 70%         |
| 100K        | 87%         |
| 1M          | 95%         |
| 5M          | 99%         |

The following SQL can be used to generate a similar list of all globally
popular websites:

```sql
SELECT distinct origin, experimental.popularity.rank
    FROM `chrome-ux-report.experimental.global`
    WHERE yyyymm = ? -- e.g., integer 202210
    GROUP BY origin, experimental.popularity.rank
    ORDER BY experimental.popularity.rank;
```

### Country-Specific Websites

[Ruth et al.](https://zakird.com/papers/browsing.pdf) also showed that browsing behavior is localized and a global top
list skews towards global sites (e.g., technology and gaming) and away from
local sites (e.g., education, government, and finance). As such, researchers
may also want to investigate whether trends hold across individual countries.

<p align="center">
<img width="500" alt="Skew in Websites" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/201296/210107148-3d0f8a03-dbf5-43fc-8ae8-072dbb97fb15.png">
</p>

Chrome publishes country-specific top lists in BigQuery and the following SQL
can be used to dump out country-specific top websites:

```sql
SELECT distinct country_code, origin, experimental.popularity.rank
    FROM `chrome-ux-report.experimental.country`
    WHERE yyyymm = ? -- e.g., integer 202210
		AND experimental.popularity.rank <= 1000000
    GROUP BY country_code, origin, experimental.popularity.rank
    ORDER BY country_code, experimental.popularity.rank;
```

The CrUX dataset is based on data collected from Google Chrome and is thus
biased away from countries with limited Chrome usage (e.g., China). If you're
specifically interested in looking at domain popularity in China, consider
[Building an Open, Robust, and Stable Voting-Based Domain Top
List](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~frankli/papers/xie_usenix2022.pdf), which
is based on data collected from 114DNS, a large DNS provider in China.


### Supporting Research

The data  in this repo is all publicly posted by Google to their
CrUX dataset in Google BigQuery. This is simply a cache of that public data.
Many of the arguments in this README are based
on two recent research papers. The first describes how we evaluated the accuracy
of lists of top websites. The second is a study on web browsing more broadly.
