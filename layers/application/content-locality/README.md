# Content locality

- Mean Jaccard similarity of each country

## Limitations

- Data limitations: [[layers/application/metrics/content-locality/data/README#Limitations]]
- Metric limitations:
	- Global average is skewed toward highly-populated internet-using countries. That means larger, more high-connectivity countries have a bigger influence on "normal" browsing behavior than smaller, low-connectivity countries. While this correctly captures the descriptive "norm" of the web, it is important to remember that fragmentation may occur more, and less Western countries are becoming connected to the internet, and viewing differnet hostnames. This is perhaps preferable to people in the Global South only being able to connect to Facebook (see: Facebook Basics).
